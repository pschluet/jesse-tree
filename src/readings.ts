      `In the beginning God made heaven and earth. The earth was invisible and unfinished; and darkness was over the deep. The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. God saw the light; it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light Day; the darkness He called Night; and there was evening and morning, one day.`,
      `Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it divide the water from the water”; and it was so. Thus God made the firmament, and God divided the water under the firmament from the water above the firmament. So God called the firmament Heaven, and God saw that it was good; and there was evening and morning, the second day.`,
      `Then God said, “Let the water under heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. The water under heaven was gathered into its places, and the dry land appeared. So God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the herb of grass, bearing seed according to its kind and likeness. Let the fruit tree bear fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind on earth.” It was so. Thus the earth brought forth the herb of grass, bearing seed according to its kind and likeness. The fruit tree bore fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind on earth. God saw that it was good. So evening and morning were the third day.`,
      `Then God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven for illumination to divide day from night. Let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years. Let them be for illumination in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth.” It was so. Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. So evening and morning were the fourth day.`,
      `Then God said, “Let the waters bring forth creatures having life, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of heaven's firmament.” It was so. Thus God made great sea creatures and every living thing that moves with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on earth.” So evening and morning were the fifth day.`,
      `Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: the quadrupeds, the creeping things, and the wild animals of the earth according to their kind.” It was so. So God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kind, the cattle according to their kind, and all the creeping things on earth according to their kind. God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of heaven, over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that moves on the earth.” So God made man; in the image of God He made him; male and female He made them. Then God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of heaven, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”`,
      `Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing herb that sows seed on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. I also give every green plant as food for all the wild animals of the earth, for all the birds of heaven, and for everything that creeps on the earth in which is the breath of life.” It was so. Then God saw everything He had made, and indeed, it was very good. So evening and morning were the sixth day.`,
      `Thus heaven and earth and all their adornment were finished. And on the seventh day God finished the works He made, and He rested on the seventh day from all the works He made. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His works God began to make.`,

    readingText: [
      `This is the book of the genesis of heaven and earth when they were made, in the day the Lord God made heaven and earth, before any plant of the field was on earth and before any herb of the field sprang up. For God had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; but a fountain came up from the ground and watered the whole face of the earth. Then God formed man out of dust from the ground, and breathed in his face the breath of life; and man became a living soul.`,
      `Then the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man He formed. Besides this, God caused every tree beautiful to the sight and good for food to grow from the ground. Also, in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of learning the knowledge of good and evil. Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated into four heads. The name of the first is Pishon. It circles all the land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good. The carbuncle and the emerald are there as well. The name of the second river is Gihon. It circles all the land of Ethiopia. The name of the third river is Tigris. It flows over against the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.`,
      `Then the Lord God took the man He formed and put him in the garden to tend and keep it. And the Lord God commanded Adam, saying, “You may eat food from every tree in the garden; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not eat; for in whatever day you eat from it, you shall die by death.”`,
      `And the Lord God said, “It is not good for man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to him.” Also, God formed out of the ground all the wild animals of the field and all the birds of heaven, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. Thus whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name. So Adam gave names to all the cattle, to all the birds of heaven, and to all the wild animals of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him. Thus God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh in its place. Then the Lord God built the rib He took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to him. So Adam said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.” Now the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.`,

      `Now the serpent was more cunning than all the wild animals the Lord God made on the earth. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat from every tree of the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden; but from the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You shall not eat from it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ” Then the serpent said to the woman, “You shall not die by death. For God knows in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw the tree was good for food, was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree beautiful to contemplate, she took its fruit and ate. She also gave it to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of the two were opened, and they knew they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.`,
      `Then they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden that afternoon, and Adam and his wife hid themselves within the tree in the middle of the garden from the presence of the Lord God. So the Lord God called Adam and said to him, “Adam, where are you?” He replied, “I heard Your voice as You were walking in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.” Thus He said, “Who said you were naked? Have you eaten from the one tree from which I commanded you not to eat?” Then Adam said, “The woman You gave me, gave me of the tree, and I ate.” So the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” Thus the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all cattle, and more than all the wild animals of the earth. On your breast and belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He shall bruise your head, and you shall be on guard for His heel.”`,
      `To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply your pain and your groaning, and in pain you shall bring forth children. Your recourse will be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.” Then to Adam He said, “Because you heeded the voice of your wife, and ate from the one tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground in your labors. In toil you shall eat from it all the days of your life. Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground from which you were taken. Earth you are, and to earth you shall return.” So Adam called his wife's name Life, because she was the mother of all living.`,
      `Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made garments of skin, and clothed them. Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. Now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—” therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of pleasure to cultivate the ground from which he was taken. So He cast out Adam, and made him dwell opposite the garden of pleasure. He then stationed the cherubim and the fiery sword which turns every way to guard the way to the tree of life.`,

    readingText: [
      `This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, who was perfect in his generation and well-pleasing to God. So Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.`,
      `Now the earth was corrupt before God and filled with unrighteousness. Thus the Lord God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh corrupted their way on the earth. Then God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with unrighteousness through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make yourself an ark of square timber. You shall make the ark in compartments, and cover it inside and outside with pitch. Thus you shall make the ark: three hundred cubits in length, fifty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height. Now when you assemble the ark, you shall gradually finish it up to a cubit at the top, and set the door in its side. You shall make the ark with lower, second, and third stories. And behold, I am bringing a flood of water on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life. Whatever is on the earth shall die. But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. From every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing on the earth after its kind, two of every kind, they will enter into the ark with you, male and female, to keep them alive. You shall also take for yourself all kinds of food to eat, and you shall gather it both for yourself and for them.” Thus Noah did according to all the Lord God commanded him, so he did.`,
      `The Flood Then the Lord God said to Noah, “Enter the ark, you and all your family, because I have seen you righteous before Me in this generation. You shall also bring with you into the ark the clean cattle by sevens, male and female; and the unclean cattle by twos, male and female; and the clean birds of heaven by twos, male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth. For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out from the face of the earth every living thing I made.” So Noah did all the Lord God commanded him.`,
      `Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.`,
      `In the six-hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the floodgates of heaven were opened. Then it rained on the earth forty days and forty nights. On the very same day Noah and his wife, his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives entered the ark. Also, all the wild animals after their kind, all cattle after their kind, every creeping thing moving upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, entered the ark with Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life. So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God commanded him. Then the Lord God shut him in the ark.`,
      `Now the flood was on the earth forty days and forty nights. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. So the waters prevailed and greatly increased on the earth, and the ark moved about on the surface of the waters. The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and covered all the high mountains. And all flesh died that moves on the earth: birds and cattle, wild animals, and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, and every man. Thus all things in whose nostrils was the breath of life, and everything on dry land, died. So He blotted out all living things on the face of the earth: both man and cattle, creeping things and the birds of heaven. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah and those with him in the ark remained alive. Now the waters prevailed on the earth one hundred and fifty days.`,
      `Then God remembered Noah, and whatever was with him in the ark: all the wild animals, all the cattle, all the birds, and all the creeping things. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided. The fountains of the deep and the floodgates of heaven were also stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. And the waters receded continually from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. Then the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.`,
      `So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground. But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself in the ark. Then he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark. The dove returned to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; and Noah knew the waters had receded from the earth. So he waited yet another seven days and again sent out the dove; however, she did not return to him any more. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year of Noah's life, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and indeed, the surface of the ground was dry. Now in the second month, on the twenty- seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.`,
      `Then the Lord God spoke to Noah, saying, 6“Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and their wives with you. Also, bring out with you every living thing of all flesh: birds and cattle and every creeping thing that moves upon the earth, so they may abound on the earth, and increase and multiply on the earth.” So Noah went out, along with his wife and his sons and their wives. Every animal, every bird, and every creeping thing that moves upon the earth, according to their kind, went out of the ark. Then Noah built an altar to God, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered whole burnt offerings on the altar. So the Lord God smelled a sweet aroma. Then the Lord God thought it over and said, “I will never again curse the earth because of man's works, although the mind of man is diligently involved with evil things from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring shall not cease by day or by night.”`,

      `Now the Lord said to Abram, “Get out of your country, from your kindred and from your father's house, to a land I will show you. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you; and in you all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.” Then Abram departed as the Lord said to him, and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he de-parted from Haran. So Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother's son and all their possessions and every soul they acquired in Haran, and they departed for the land of Canaan. Thus they came to the land of Canaan. Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, as far as the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land. Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your seed I will give this land.” And there Abram built an altar to the Lord, who appeared to him.`,
      `After these things the Word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield and will be your exceedingly great reward.” But Abram said, “Lord, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus, the son of Masek, my domestic maidservant?” Then Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed, my household servant is my heir.” And immediately the Voice of the Lord came to him, saying, “This one shall not be your heir, but the One who will come from your own body shall be your heir.” Then He brought him outside and said to him, “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your seed be.” And Abram believed God, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.`,
      `When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am your God; be pleasing before Me and blameless. I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.” Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, 4“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations. No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be your God and the God of your seed after you. Also I will give you and your seed after you the land you are occupying as a sojourner, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”`,

      `Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham! Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then He said, “Take now your beloved son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a whole burnt offering on one of the mountains I tell you.”`,
      `So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split firewood for the whole burnt offering, and arose and went to the place God told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. Thus Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.”`,
      `So Abraham took the firewood of the whole burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. Then he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. Then Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” Then he said, “Look, the fire and the firewood, but where is the sheep for a whole burnt offering?” And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the sheep for a whole burnt offering.” So the two of them went together. They came to the place where God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the firewood in order; and he bound Isaac his son hand and foot and laid him on the altar, upon the firewood.`,
      `Then Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” So he said, “Here I am.” He then replied, “Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him, for now I know you fear God, since for My sake you have not spared your beloved son.” Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him a ram was caught in a thicket by its horns. So he brought it for a whole burnt offering in the place of his son. Thus Abraham called the name of the place The-Lord-Has-Appeared; as it is said to this day, “In the mountain the Lord was seen.”`,
      `Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, and said, “By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you did this thing, and for My sake did not spare your beloved son, I will certainly bless you, and assuredly multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the seashore; and your seed shall inherit the cities of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you obeyed My voice.”`,

      `Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. He also made him a tunic of many colors. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak civilly to him.`,
      `Then Joseph had a dream, and reported it to his brothers. Thus he said to them, “Hear this dream I dreamed: There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.” So his brothers said to him, “Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.`,
      `Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, “Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.” So he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream you have dreamed? Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come and bow down on the ground before you?” And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter in mind.`,
      `Then his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers shepherding the sheep in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” So he said to him, “Here I am.” Then Israel said to him, “Go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the sheep, and bring back word to me.” So he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem.`,
      `Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field. So the man asked him, saying, “What are you seeking?” He replied, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me where they are feeding their sheep.” The man said to him, “They have departed from here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.”’ So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan. Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him. Then they said to one another, “Look, this dreamer is coming. Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, ‘Some wild beast has devoured him.’ We shall see what will become of his dreams.”`,
      `But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, “Let us not kill him.” Again, Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit in the desert; and do not lay a hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father. So it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped the tunic of many colors off him. Then they took him and cast him into a pit, which was empty; for there was no water in it.`,
      `They then sat down to eat a meal, and lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of Ishmaelite wayfarers coming from Gilead with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry them down to Egypt. So Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh”; and his brothers listened. Thus the Midianite traders passed by, and the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit; and they sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of gold. So they took Joseph to Egypt. Then Reuben returned to the pit, and when he saw Joseph was not in there, he tore his clothes. So he returned to his brothers and said, “The lad is not there; and I, where shall I go?”`,
      `Thus they took Joseph's tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood. Then they sent the tunic of many colors, and had it brought to their father and said, “We found this. Do you know whether it is your son's tunic or not?” So he recognized it and said, “This is my son's tunic. A wild animal has devoured Joseph and carried him off.” Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. Thus all his sons and daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, “I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning.” So his father wept for him. Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.`,

But the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine-looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke. He slept and dreamed a second time; and suddenly seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, plump and good. Then behold, seven ears of corn, thin and blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them. But the seven thin ears of corn devoured the seven plump and full ears. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, it was a dream.`,
      `Now it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the interpreters of Egypt and all its wise men. Thus Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh. Then the cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my sin this day. When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the chief bodyguard, both myself and the chief baker, we each had a dream in one night, both he and I. Each had a dream regarding himself. Now there was with us a young Hebrew servant of the chief bodyguard, and we related our dreams to him; and he interpreted them for us. And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, but he hanged him.”`,
      `Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him quickly out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh. Thus Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it.” So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”`,
      `Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do: The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears of corn are seven years; the dreams are one. But the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are seven years of famine. This is the thing I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. Indeed, seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of Egypt; but after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land. So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following, for it will be very severe. Now the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a sensible and intelligent man, and set him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint governors over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years.`,
      `That food shall then be as a reserve in the land for the seven coming years of famine in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.” Joseph Made Ruler of Egypt Now this advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.`,
      `Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, there is no one as sensible and intelligent as you. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.” So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”`,
      `Then Pharaoh took the signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph's hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. Then he had him ride in the second of his chariots; and they cried out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he set him over all the land of Egypt. Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”`,
      `The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. Then all countries also came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.`,
      `When Jacob found out there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you standing idle?” Then he said, “Indeed, I heard there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy for us there, that we may live and not die.” So Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “Lest some calamity befall him.”`,
      `Thus the sons of Israel went to buy grain with those who were going there, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. Now Joseph was governor over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. So Joseph's brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke roughly to them. Then he said to them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.” So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.`,
      `Then they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.” But Joseph said to them, “It is as I spoke to you, namely, ‘You are spies!’ In this manner you shall be manifested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.`,
      `Then they said to one another, “We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not hear; therefore this distress has come upon us.” Reuben then answered them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the boy,’ but you would not listen? Therefore, behold, his blood is now required of us.” But they did not know Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter.`,
      `Then Joseph turned himself away from them and wept. So he returned to them again, and talked with them; and took Simeon from them, and bound him before their eyes. Joseph then gave a command to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every man's money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them.`,
      `So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.`,

      `But there arose a new king over Egypt who knew not Joseph. Then he said to his nation, “Look, the race of the children of Israel is a great multitude and is stronger than we; come, let us outwit them, lest they multiply, and it happen in the event of war that they also join our enemies and fight against us and so escape out of the land.” Therefore he set taskmasters over them to afflict them in their works; and they built for Pharaoh strong cities —Pithom and Raamses and On, which is Heliopolis. But the more they humbled them, the more they multiplied and grew; and the Egyptians greatly abhorred the children of Israel. So the Egyptians tyrannized the children of Israel by force. They made their lives bitter with hard labor—in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their labor in which they made them serve was by violence.`,
      `So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every male born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the river, but every female you shall save alive.”`,
      `Now a man of the house of Levi went and took as wife a daughter of Levi. So the woman conceived and bore a son; and seeing he was a beautiful child, they hid him three months. But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of bulrushes, daubed it with asphalt, put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank. Now his sister was watching from a distance to learn what would be done with him.`,
      `Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along the riverside; and seeing the ark among the reeds, she sent a maid to get it. So when she opened the ark, she saw the child crying, and the daughter of Pharaoh had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” So Pharaoh's daughter said to her, “Go.” Then the maiden went and called the child's mother. Pharaoh's daughter then said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. Now when the boy was grown, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son; and she called his name Moses, saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.”`,

      `Now Moses was tending the sheep of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. Then he led them to the back of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. Then the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he saw the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed. So Moses said, “I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed.”`,
      `When therefore the Lord saw him turn aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses! Moses!” Then he said, “Here I am.” So He said, “Do not come any closer. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.” Moreover He said, “I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses then hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.`,
      `Then the Lord said, “Indeed, I have seen the affliction of My people in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrow. So I came down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Gergesites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the affliction with which the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, I will send you to Pharaoh, to bring My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt.”`,
      `But Moses said to God, “Who am I to go to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt?” Then God said to Moses, “I will be with you, and this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.” So Moses said to God, “Indeed, when I go to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I tell them?”`,
      `Then God said to Moses, “I AM the Existing One.” He also said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘The Existing One sent me to you.’ ” Moreover God said to Moses again, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘The Lord God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and My memorial to all generations. Go then, and gather the elders of the children of Israel together and say to them, ‘The Lord God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—appeared to me, saying, “I have surely looked upon you and all the things that happened to you in Egypt; and I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Gergesites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’”`,

      `In the day the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, the Lord said to him, “I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.” But Moses said before the Lord, “Behold, I am weak in speech; and how shall Pharaoh heed me?”`,
      `Now the Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet. You shall speak all I command you, and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh to send the children of Israel from his land. I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh will not heed you; and I shall lay My hand on Egypt and bring My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt with My power and great vengeance. Then all the Egyptians shall know I am the Lord, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.” Thus, as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.`,
      `So the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go. Go to Pharaoh early in the morning, when he goes to the water, and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him; and you shall take in your hand the rod that turned to a serpent. Then you shall say to him, ‘The Lord God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, to serve Me in the desert”; but indeed, until now you would not hear. Thus says the Lord: “By this you shall know I am the Lord. Behold, I will strike the water in the river with the rod in my hand, and it shall be turned to blood. Then the fish in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the river.”’”`,
      `Then the Lord spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron your brother, ‘Take your rod in your hand and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, their canals, their ponds, and all their standing water, so they may become blood. There shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone.’”`,
      `So Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded them. Aaron lifted his hand with the rod and struck the waters in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants. Then all the waters in the river were turned to blood. The fish in the river died, the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. Then the sorcerers of Egypt did the same with their sorceries; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as the Lord said.`,
      `So all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink water from the river. Then seven days passed after the Lord struck the river.`,
      `Now the Lord spoke to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Let My people go to serve Me. But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your territory with frogs. So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants, on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls. The frogs shall come up on you, your people, and all your servants.”’”`,
      `Again the Lord spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron your brother, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.’” So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. Then the sorcerers did the same with their sorceries and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.`,
      `Pharaoh then called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the Lord for me, and let Him take away the frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go and sacrifice to the Lord.” Moses replied to Pharaoh, “Appoint me a time when I shall pray for you, for your servants, and for your people to make the frogs disappear from you, your people, and your houses. Only in the river will they remain.” So Pharaoh said, “Tomorrow.” Moses then said, “Let it be according to your word, that you may know this is none other than the Lord. Now the frogs shall depart from you, your houses, your servants, and your people. They shall remain in the river only.”`,
      `Then Moses and Aaron departed from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the Lord about the time He had agreed to, concerning the frogs He had brought against Pharaoh. So the Lord did just as Moses said, and the frogs died away from the houses, the villages, and the fields. Then they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. But when Pharaoh saw there was relief, his heart was hardened; and he did not heed them, as the Lord said.`,
      `Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the land, that it may become lice on men, on four-footed animals, and throughout all the land of Egypt.’ ” Thus Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and four-footed animals; and there were lice in all the dust of the land. Now the sorcerers so worked with their sorceries to bring forth lice, but they could not; and there were lice on man and four-footed animals. Then the sorcerers said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as the Lord said.`,
      `Now the Lord said to Moses, “I will bring yet one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward, he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out of here.`,
      `Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 2“This month shall be your beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the family households, a lamb for each home. If there be too few in a household, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of souls; he will make his count in lambs according to the needs of each one. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take it from the sheep or the kids. Then you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at twilight. Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat it. They shall eat the flesh on that night, roasted in fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted in fire—its head with its legs and its entrails. You shall let none of it remain until morning, nor shall you break a bone of it; and what remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire. Thus you shall eat it: with a belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Pascha. For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute vengeance: I am the Lord. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.`,
      `Then the children of Israel went away and did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.`,
      `Now it came to pass at midnight that the Lord struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive woman in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the cattle. So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in all the land of Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead. Then he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Rise, go out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel. Go and serve the Lord as you said. Take also your sheep and oxen and go, and bless me as well.”`,

      `So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham by the desert. Moreover, God led them, by day in a pillar of cloud to show them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire. Thus the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before all the people.`,
      `Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel that they turn and camp at the village between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before them by the sea. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are wandering in the land; the desert has closed them in.’ Then I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh and over all his army, that the Egyptians may know I am the Lord.” So they did.`,
      `Now it was told the king of the Egyptians that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, “Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him. Also, he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them. Thus the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand. So the Egyptians pursued them, all the cavalry and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the village opposite Baal Zephon.`,
      `Now when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord. Then they said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the desert? Why have you so dealt with us to bring us up out of Egypt? Is this not the word we told you in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert.”`,
      `Then Moses said to the people, “Be of good courage. Stand still and see the Lord's salvation which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you will never see again. The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.”`,
      `Then the Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. Now lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it; and let the children of Israel go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. I indeed will harden Pharaoh's heart and all the Egyptians, and they will go in after them. So I will be glorified in Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horses. Then the Egyptians will know I am the Lord, when I am glorified upon Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horses.”`,
      `Now the Angel of God who went before the camp of Israel moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud also went from before them and stood behind them. So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and the night passed; but there was such darkness and blackness, they did not come near one another all that night. Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord carried back the sea by a strong south wind all that night and made the sea dry ground. Thus the waters were divided. So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Then the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen. Now it came to pass, in the morning watch, the Lord looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud; and He troubled the army of the Egyptians. He bound the axles of their chariot wheels and caused them to proceed with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians.”`,
      `Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots and the riders.” So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were trying to flee. But the Lord shook off the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. Then the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all of Pharaoh's army that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained. But the children of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea. The waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. So the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Thus Israel saw the Lord's mighty hand and the things He did to the Egyptians; therefore, the people feared the Lord and believed God and His servant Moses.`,

      `Thus Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea; then they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the desert and found no water to drink. Now when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore he named that place Bitterness. Then the people complained against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” So he cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them. There He proved him and said, “If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is pleasing in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His ordinances, I will put none of the diseases on you that I brought on the Egyptians; for I am the Lord your God who heals you.”`,
      `Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters.`,
      `Manna and Quail 6 Now they journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt.`,

      `Then the Lord said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you tablets of stone and the law and commandments I wrote, that you may teach them.” So Moses arose with his assistant Joshua, and they went up to the mountain of God. But he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Indeed, Aaron and Hur are with you. If any man has a difficulty, let him go to them.” Then Moses and Joshua went up the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. Now the glory of God descended on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. Then on the seventh day the Lord called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. The sight of the Lord's glory was like a burning fire on the top of the mountain before the children of Israel. So Moses went into the midst of the cloud and went up the mountain; and he was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.`,

      `In the days of the judges there was a famine in the land. And a man went from Bethlehem of Judah to sojourn in the country of Moab, and his wife and his sons. The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion—Ephrathites from Bethlehem of Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there. Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons. They took for themselves wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years. Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband. `,
      `Naomi Returns to Judah with Ruth`,
      `Then she arose with her two daughters-in-law and returned from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord was watching over His people by giving them bread. Therefore she and her two daughters-in-law left the place where she was and returned to the land of Judah. And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each to her mother's house. May the Lord have mercy on you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. The Lord grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. And they said to her, “We will return with you to your people.” But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why do you desire to go with me? Are there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?`,
      `Then they lifted up their voices and again wept. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people, but Ruth followed her. `,
      `And Naomi said to Ruth, “Look, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” But Ruth said, “Do not ask me to leave you, or turn back from following you; for wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. And wherever you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord cause this to happen to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.”`,
      `So Naomi returned and Ruth the 2 Moabite woman returned with her, her daughter-in-law who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.`,
      `Boaz Favors Ruth`,
      `There was a relative of Naomi's husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz. So Ruth the Moabite woman said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, daughter.” Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.`,
      `Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Did you not hear, daughter? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women. Let your eyes be on the field that my men reap, and follow after them. Behold, I have commanded the young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men draw.” So she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a stranger?”`,
      `And Boaz answered and said to her, “It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done with your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know yesterday or the day before. May the Lord repay your work, and may a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.” Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken to the heart of your maidservant. Behold, I will be like one of your bondswomen.” Now Boaz said to her, “It is already time to eat. Come here and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So Ruth sat beside the reapers, and Boaz made a pile of grain for her; and she ate and was satisfied, and kept some back.`,
      `And she rose up to glean, and Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not bring shame upon her. When you carry sheaves, carry them for her also; and when you throw them on the piles, throw them for her also; and let her gather from what has piled up, and do not rebuke her.” So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat with a rod what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.`,
      `Then she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. So Ruth brought forth and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied. And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.” So Ruth told her mother-in-law where she had worked and said, “The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.” Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed is he of the Lord, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!” And Naomi said to her, “This man is a relation of ours, one of our close relatives.” Ruth said to her mother-in-law, “He also said to me, ‘Stay near by my young men until they finish all my reap-ing.’ ” And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and thus people will not meet you in another field.” So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.`,
      `Boaz Pledges to Redeem Ruth`,
      `Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “Daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, so that it will be well with you? Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. Therefore, wash and anoint yourself, put on your best garment and go up to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished drinking and eating. Then, when he lies down, take notice of the place where he lies. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.” And Ruth said to her, “I will do everything you say.”`,
      `So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all her mother-in-law instructed her. And Boaz ate, and his heart was cheerful. He went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain, and she came softly and uncovered his feet. Now it happened at midnight 4 that the man was startled and disturbed; for there was a woman lying at his feet. And he said, “Who are you?” So she answered, “I am Ruth, your maidservant. Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are a close relative.”`,
      `Then Boaz said, “Blessed are you of the Lord God, daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether rich or poor. And now, daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all you request, for the whole tribe of my people knows that you are a virtuous woman. Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I. Stay here for the night. And in the morning, if he performs the duty of a kinsman for you, we will let him do it. But if he does not wish to perform the duty for you, then as the Lord lives, I will perform the duty for you. Lie down until morning.”`,
      `So she lay at his feet until morning, and she rose before anyone could recognize another. Then Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.” And he said to her, “Bring the apron that is around you.” And as she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. Then she went into the city. So when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “Is that you, my daughter?” Then Ruth told her all the man had done for her. And she said to her, “He gave me these six ephahs of barley; for he said to me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ” Then she said, “Sit still, daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter today.”`,
      `Boaz Marries Ruth`,
      `Boaz went up to the gate and sat there; and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz had spoken was passing. So Boaz said to him, “Come aside, sir, sit down here.” So he came aside and sat down. And Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.`,
      `Then Boaz said to the relative, “As to the field which was our brother Elimelech's, which was given to Naomi, now returning from the land of Moab; I said I would inform you, saying, ‘Buy it back in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.’ ” And he said, “I am here, I will redeem it.” Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi and from Ruth the Moabite woman, the wife of the deceased, you must take her as well, so as to raise up the name of the dead through his inheritance.” And the close relative said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”`,
      `Now, this was the legal custom in former times of Israel concerning redemption, and for a bargain, to confirm every word: A man took off his sandal and gave it to his neighbor who redeemed his right, and this was the testimony in Israel. And the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy my right of redemption for yourself.” So he took off his sandal and gave it to him. And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi. Moreover, I bought for myself, to be my wife, Ruth the Moabite woman, the wife of Mahlon, to raise up the name of the dead through his inheritance; so the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the tribe of his people. You are witnesses today.” And all the people who were at the gate said, “We are witnesses.” And the elders said, “May the Lord make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel and wrought mightily in Ephrathah. She will have a name in Bethlehem. And out of the seed which the Lord will give you from this young woman, may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”`,
      `So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son. Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not suffered a redeemer to fail you this day, even to make your name famous in Israel! And he will be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.” Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse for him. And the neighbors themselves gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi”; and they called his name Obed. This is the father of Jesse, the father of David.`,

    readingText: [
      `There was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the mountain of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeremeel, the son of Elihu, the son of Toke in Nasiv Ephraim. He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other was Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah none. And each year the man went up from his city of Ramathaim to worship and sacrifice to Lord Sabaoth in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, both priests of the Lord, went there as well. And on the day he came, Elkanah sacrificed and gave a portion to Peninnah his wife, and to his sons and daughters. To Hannah, he gave one portion, since she was without child. However Elkanah loved Hannah more than the other one, but the Lord had closed her womb. Because the Lord did not give to her a child during her tribulation, and during the discouragement of her tribulation, she was broken-hearted. The Lord had closed her womb and did not give her a child. So year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord, she was broken-hearted and wept and did not eat.`,
      `Hannah's Vow`,
      `Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah.” And she said to him, “Here I am, lord.” Then he said to her, “What is the matter with you? Why do you not eat? And why are you heartsick? Am I not better for you than ten children?” So Hannah arose after they had finished eating in Shiloh, and she sat down before the Lord. Eli the priest was sitting nearby on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord. Hannah was grieved in spirit and prayed to the Lord, lamenting and weeping. She prayed a vow to the Lord God and said, “O Lord, my God of Sabaoth, if you are looking, look with favor upon the lowly state of Your handmaiden and remember me. I pray You, give Your handmaiden a seed of men, a son, and I will dedicate him before You as a gift until the day of his death. He will not drink wine nor intoxicating drink, and no razor shall come upon his head.”`,
      `And as she kept praying before the Lord, Eli watched her mouth. And as she spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. The servant of God said to her, “For how long will you remain drunk? Cast off your wine, and go out from the face of the Lord!” But Hannah answered and said, “No lord, I am a woman for whom this day is difficult. I drank neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I pour out my soul before the Lord. Do not consider your handmaiden a daughter of pestilence just because of the multitude of my idle words I have put forth.” Then Eli answered and said to her, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you the petition you asked of Him.” And she said, “Your handmaiden has found favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and came into her lodging and ate and drank with her husband. Her face was no longer fallen.`,
      `Birth and Dedication of Samuel`,
      `Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped the Lord and went on their way back to Elkanah's house at Ramathaim. And he knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her. She conceived, and it came to be at the appointed time she bore a son, and she called him Samuel and said, “Because I asked for him from the Lord God Sabaoth.”`,
      `Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to Shiloh to offer the yearly sacrifice, his vow, and the tenth portion of all his land. But Hannah did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, “I will not go up until our boy is weaned from me. Then he will appear in the presence of the Lord and stay there continually.” And Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what is good in your eyes; wait until you have weaned him.`,
      `Only let the Lord confirm as true what was coming out of your mouth.” So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him. And she went up with him to Shiloh with a calf three years old, loaves of bread, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She came to the house of the Lord in Shiloh, and the child 2 was with them. And they came before the Lord, and his father slaughtered the offering he made yearly to the Lord. He brought the child and slaughtered the calf. Then Hannah, the mother of the young boy, went to Eli. And she said to him, “Lord, as your soul lives, I am the woman who was standing near you while I prayed to the Lord. For this child I prayed, and the Lord gave me my request which I asked from Him. And I lend him to the Lord all the days which he lives to be fruitful to the Lord.”`,
      `Hannah's Prayer`,
      `And she said:`,
      `“My heart is strengthened in the Lord; My horn is exalted in my God. I smile at my enemies; I rejoice in Your salv ation. 2 Because no one is holy like the Lord, No one is righteous like our God, No one is holy but You. 3 Do not boast nor speak of high things; Let no arrogance come from y our mouth, For the Lord is the God of knowledge; And God is preparing His actions. 4 He weakened the bow of mighty men, And those who are weak are girded with strength. 5 Those who were full of bread were made empty , And the hungry hav e forsaken the land. The barren woman has borne sev en, And she who has many children has become feeble. 6 The Lord kills and makes aliv e; He brings down to Hades and raises up. 7 The Lord makes poor and rich; He brings low and lifts up. 8 He raises the poor from the earth And lifts the needy from the dung heap, To set them among princely people And make them inherit a throne of glory . 9 The One who giv es a pray er to the one pray ing, He blesses with righteous y ears; For by strength no man can prev ail. 0 The Lord makes His adv ersaries weak; The Lord is holy . Let not the man of learning boast in his understanding, Nor let the man of might boast in his might, Nor let the man of riches boast in his riches. Only let the one who boasts boast in this: To understand and to know the Lord And to do justice and righteousness in the midst of the earth. The Lord went up into the heav en and thundered.

      `The boy Samuel ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no discerning vision. So on that day, while Eli was lying down in his place, his eyes were starting to grow heavy, barely able to see. Before the lamp of God went out, and while Samuel was asleep in the temple where the ark of God was, the Lord called, “Samuel, Samuel.” Samuel answered, “Here I am!” So he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” And Eli said, “I did not call you. Return and lie down.” So he returned and lay down. Then the Lord called again, “Samuel, Samuel!” So Samuel went to Eli a second time, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Eli answered, “I did not call you. Return and lie down.”`,
      `Now this all happened before Samuel knew the Lord, and before the word of the Lord was revealed to him. And the Lord called Samuel again a third time. Then he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the Lord had called the boy. And he said, “Return, lie down, my child; and if He calls you, you must say, ‘O Lord, speak, for Your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and fell asleep in his place.`,
      `And the Lord came, and stood and called as before. So Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.” Then the Lord said to Samuel, “Behold! I shall execute My words in Israel, and for everyone hearing them, both ears will tingle. In that day, I will raise up against Eli everything I spoke concerning his house. This I will begin, and I will finish it. For I announced to him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity of his sons. For his sons reviled God, and he did not correct them in any way. I swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall never be atoned for with incense or with sacrifice.”`,
      `So Samuel fell asleep and rose early in the morning. He opened the doors of the Lord's house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision. Then Eli called to Samuel, “Samuel, my child!” And he answered, “Here I am.” And Eli said, “What was the report the Lord spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do these things to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of what He said to you.” Then Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, “He is the Lord. He will do what seems good to Him.”`,
      `So Samuel grew and matured, and the Lord was with him, and not one of his words fell to the ground. And all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was faithful as a prophet of the Lord.`,

      `Now the Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with olive oil and come. I will send you to Jesse in Bethlehem, for I have seen someone among his sons to reign for Me.” And Samuel said, “How can I go? Saul will hear it and he will kill me.” And the Lord said, “Take a heifer in your arms and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You shall anoint the one I tell you.”`,
      `So Samuel did everything the Lord said to him and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town were astonished at meeting him, and they said, “Seer, do you come in peace?” And he said, “Peaceably I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves and rejoice with me today.” Then he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and he invited them to the sacrifice. And it came to be when they entered that Samuel looked at Eliab and said, “Surely the anointed of the Lord is before Him.” But the Lord said to Samuel, “Have no regard for his outward appearance, nor for the maturity of his stature, because I have refused him. For man does not see as God sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord sees into the heart.”`,
      `So Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And Samuel said, “The Lord did not choose this one either.” Then Jesse brought Shammah. But Samuel said, “Nor has the Lord chosen this one.” Thus Jesse brought seven of his sons before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The Lord has not chosen these.” Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are there any other young men here?” Then Jesse said, “There remains yet the youngest, keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.” So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and goodlooking to the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, “Arise, anoint David; for he is good!” Then Samuel took the horn of olive oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.

      `Now the Philistines brought their armies together for battle, and they gathered at Sochoh of Judah. They encamped between Sochoh and Azekah in Ephes Dammim. And Saul and the men of Israel gathered, and they were encamped in the valley. They were to set up in battle formation opposite the Philistines. The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.`,
      `And a mighty man went out from the battle line of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath. His height was four cubits and a span. He had a helmet on his head, and he wore a breastplate of chain mail; and the weight of his breastplate was five thousand shekels of brass and iron. And he had armor made of bronze on his legs and a bronze shield between his shoulders. Now the staff of his spear was like the beam of a loom, and his iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels. A shield-bearer went before him. Then he stood and shouted out to the armies of Israel and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up for battle against us? Am I not a Philistine, and you Hebrews of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I am able to kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” And the Philistine said, “Look! This very day I challenge the ranks of the armies of Israel. Give me a man that the two of us can fight one on one.” When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.`,
      `But David said to Saul, “Let not the heart of my lord fall in regards to him. Your servant will go and fight with this foreigner.” And Saul said to David, “No, you are not able to go to the Philistine to fight him, since you are a young man, and he is a man of war from his youth.” But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to tend the flock for his father, and when a lion or a bear came and took a sheep out of the flock, I followed it and struck it, and delivered the sheep from its mouth. And as it arose against me, I caught it by its throat and struck and killed it. Your servant smote both the lion and the bear; and the uncircumcised Philistine will be as one of them to me. Will I not go and kill him today, and remove the reproach of Israel? For who is this uncircumcised one who challenged the ranks of the armies of Israel? The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord will be with you!”`,
      `So Saul clothed David with armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head, and he girded David with his sword over his armor. David made a trial walking with them a time or two. And David said to Saul, “I am not able to go with these, for I have not tested them.” So they removed them. Then David took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook. He put them in a shepherd's bag to store away, and in his hand was his sling. He then approached the Philistine.`,
      `And when Goliath saw David, he disdained him; for he was a young boy, ruddy with a good countenance. So the Philistine said to David, “Am I as a dog, that you come against me with a staff and stones?” Then David said, “No, worse than a dog!” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. And the Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of heaven and the beasts of the field!”`,
      `Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a shield. But I come to you in the name of the Lord Sabaoth, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you reproached today. Today the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will kill you and take your head from you. And this day I will give your carcass and the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of heaven and the wild beasts of the earth, and all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel. Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's, and the Lord will deliver you into our hands.”`,
      `And the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David. Then David put his hand in his bag and took out one stone. He slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone penetrated through his helmet and into his forehead. He fell to the ground on his face. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone. He struck the Philistine and killed him, and there was no sword in the hand of David. Therefore, David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword, and killed him and cut off his head. And the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, and they fled.`,
      `Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued them as far as the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ashkelon. And the wounded Philistines fell on the way to the gates, even as far as Gath and Ashkelon. Then the men of Israel returned from pursuing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem. He put his armor in his tent.`,

      `Then King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king. The king said to them, “Take the servants of your lord with you, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon. There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him as king over Israel, and blow the ram's horn, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ Then he shall sit on my throne and be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”`,
      `So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites mounted Solomon on King David's mule, and they led him to Gihon. Then Zadok the priest took a horn of olive oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram's horn, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” Then all the people went up after him, and the people danced and rejoiced with great joy. So the earth burst forth with their sound.`,
      `David's Final Words to Solomon`,
      `Now the days of David drew near to death, and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 2“I am going the way of all the earth, but you must be strong and become a man. Keep the charge of the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His commandments and statutes, and the writings of His judgments in the Law of Moses, so you may understand what you shall do regarding whatever I command of you; that the Lord may confirm His word which He spoke, saying, ‘If your sons guard their way and go before Me in truth, with their whole heart and their whole soul, I say to you, a man from them shall not fail to sit on the throne of Israel.’`,
      `The Death of King David`,
      `So David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. Thus Solomon sat on the throne of David, his father, and the kingdom was exceedingly well established.`,
      `God Appears to Solomon`,
      `Solomon said, “You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, and with You in righteousness and uprightness of heart. You have continued this great kindness for him, and gave him a son to sit on his throne, as I do today. Now, O Lord my God, You made Your servant king in place of my father David, but I am a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You chose, a great people, who will not be numbered. Therefore give Your servant a heart to hear and judge Your people in righteousness, and to discern between good and evil. For who can judge this great people of Yours?”`,
      `The Lord was pleased that Solomon asked this. So the Lord said to him, “Because you asked for this, and have not asked for long life for yourself; nor have you asked for riches, nor for the life of your enemies, but asked understanding for yourself, to understand judgment— behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you an understanding and wise heart, so there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall anyone like you arise after you. I also gave you what you did not ask—both riches and honor—so there has been no man like you among kings. If you walk in My ways, and keep My statutes and commandments, as your father David did, then I will multiply your days.”`,
      `Solomon awoke, and indeed it was a dream. He arose and came to Jerusalem and stood before the altar, before the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Zion. He offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for himself and all his servants.`,

      `When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Are you the one who is troubling Israel?” Elijah answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but rather you and the house of your father, in that you forsook the Lord your God and followed after the Baals. Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of shame, and the four hundred prophets of the sacred groves who eat at Jezebel's table.”`,
      `The Victory over Baal`,
      `So Ahab went back to Israel and gathered all the prophets on Mount Carmel. Then Elijah came near to all of them and said, “How long will you be undecided between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him, but if Baal, follow him.” But the people did not answer. Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone remain as a prophet of the Lord, but there are four hundred and fifty men who are prophets of Baal and four hundred prophets of the sacred groves. Let them give us two oxen. Then let them choose one bull for themselves, to be cut into pieces and laid on the wood; but they shall not light a fire under it. I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood; and I will not light a fire under it. Then you will call loudly on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord, my God. So it shall come to pass that the God who answers by fire, He is God.” So all the people answered and said, “The word you have spoken is good.”`,
      `Then Elijah said to the prophets of shame, “Choose one calf for yourselves and prepare it, for there are many of you. Then call on the name of your god, but do not put fire to the wood under it.” So they took a calf and prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “Hear us, O Baal, hear us.” But there was no voice, for no one answered, and they ran about the altar they had made.`,
      `Then it came to pass at noon that Elijah the Tishbite mocked them and said, “Cry out with a loud voice, for he is a god; for either he is away meditating, or he is too busy, or preoccupied with other business. Perhaps he is sleeping and has need to be awakened from his nap.” So they cried aloud and cut themselves with knives and lances, as is their custom, until blood gushes forth. They prophesied until early evening, until the appointed time to offer the evening sacrifice. But even still, there was no voice. Finally, Elijah the Tishbite spoke to the prophets of the idols, saying, “Now remove yourselves from this place, for I will offer my whole burnt offering.” And they turned away and departed.`,
      `Then Elijah said to the people, “Come near me.” So all the people came near to him. Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, for the Lord said, “Israel shall be your name.” Then he built an altar with the stones in the name of the Lord, and he repaired the altar of sacrifice that was scattered about, and around the altar he made a furrow holding two measures of seed. He piled the firewood on the altar he had made, divided the whole burnt offering, laid it on the firewood, and laid it in order on the altar. Then he said, “Bring me four pots of water, and pour it on the whole burnt offering and pour it on the unlit firewood.” They did so. Again Elijah said, “Do it a second time.” So they did it again. Again he said, “Do it a third time.” So they did it a third time. And the water ran all about the altar, and even the furrow became filled with water.`,
      `After this, Elijah cried out to heaven and said, “O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, answer me, O Lord, answer me this day with fire, and let this people know You are the God of Israel, and I am Your servant; and for Your sake I do all these works. Hear me, O Lord, hear me with fire, and let these people know You are the Lord God, so as turn the heart of this people back.”`,
      `Then fire fell from the Lord out of the heaven and consumed the whole burnt offering, the firewood, and the water in the furrow. The fire also licked up the stones and the soil. So all the people fell on their faces, and they said, “Truly, the Lord is God; He is God.” Elijah then said to the people, “Seize the prophets of Baal. Let not one of them escape.” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon, where he slaughtered them.`,

      `Jonah Flees from the Lord`,
      `Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, “Arise and go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach in it; for the cry of her wickedness has come up to me.” But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. So he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish, paid his fare, and boarded the ship to set sail with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.`,
      `But the Lord raised up a great wind upon the sea, and there came about a mighty tempest, and the ship was in danger of breaking up. And the mariners were afraid and cried out, each one to his god. And they cast out the cargo of the ship into the sea, attempting to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, had gone to sleep, and was snoring.`,
      `The captain came to him and said, “Why are you snoring? Get up and call upon your God, that your God may keep us safe so we do not perish.” And each one said to his shipmate, “Come! Let us cast lots and find out on whose account this calamity is upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.`,
      `Then they said to him, “Tell us, what is your occupation? Where do you come from and from what country and people are you?” And he said to them, “I am a servant of the Lord, and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, “What is this that you did?” For the men knew he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them. Then they said to him, “What should we do to you that the sea will calm itself for us?” For the sea continued to be tempestuous, and the waves rose up even higher. And Jonah said to them, “Take me up and cast me into the sea, and the sea will grow calm for you, for I know this great tempest is upon you because of me.”`,
      `And the men tried hard to return to the land, but were unable to do so, for the sea arose and grew even more tempestuous against them. Then they cried out to the Lord and said, “Please, O Lord, do not let us perish on account of this man's life, nor bring righteous blood upon us; for you, O Lord, have brought this about.” So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. And the men feared the Lord even more, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and vowed vows.`,
      `Jonah's Song of Thanksgiving`,
      `Now the Lord commanded a huge sea creature to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the sea creature three days and three nights. And from the belly of the sea creature, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God, and said:`,
      `“I cried out in my affliction to the Lord, my God,`,
      `And He heard my voice;`,
      `Out of the belly of Hades, You heard the cry of my voice.`,
      `You cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea,`,
      `And rivers encompassed me;`,
      `All Your surging waters and Your waves passed over me.`,
      `And I said, ‘I have been driven away from Your sight;`,
      `Shall I again look with favor toward Your holy temple?’`,
      `Water is poured over me to my soul;`,
      `The lowest depth encircled me;`,
      `My head plunged into the clefts of the mountains.`,
      `I descended into the earth,`,
      `The bars of which are everlasting barriers;`,
      `Yet let my life ascend from corruption, O Lord, my God.`,
      `When my soul was failing from me, I remembered the Lord.`,
      `May my prayer be brought to You, into Your holy temple.`,
      `Those who follow vanity and lies forsake their own mercy.`,
      `But with a voice of thanksgiving and praise,`,
      `I will sacrifice to You.`,
      `As much as I vowed, I shall offer up to You,`,
      `To You, the Lord of Deliverance.”`,
      `Then the Lord commanded the sea creature, and it cast up Jonah onto the dry land.`,
      `The Repentance of Nineveh`,
      `Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying, “Arise and go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach there according to the message I previously spoke to you.” So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, just as the Lord spoke. Nineveh was an exceedingly great city to God, a journey of about three days. And Jonah began to enter into the city, going a day's journey, where he proclaimed and said, “Yet three days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”`,
      `And the men of Nineveh believed God. They proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least. Then the word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, and put on sackcloth, and sat upon ashes. And it was proclaimed and spoken in Nineveh by the king and by his great men, saying, “Let not the men, cattle, oxen, or sheep taste anything, eat, or drink water.” So the men and the cattle were clothed with sackcloth, and they cried out fervently to God; and they each turned back from their evil ways and from the wrongdoings of their hands, saying, 9“Who knows if God shall have a change of heart and turn from His fierce anger, that we should not perish?” And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways. And God had a change of heart about the evil which He said He would do to them, and He did not do it.`,
      `Jonah Is Grieved by the Lord's Compassion`,
      `But Jonah was deeply grieved and was troubled. So he prayed to the Lord and said, “O Lord, were these not my words when I was yet in my land? Therefore I saw the need to flee to Tarshish; because I knew You to be compassionate and merciful, longsuffering and abundant in mercy, and willing to change your heart concerning evils. And now, Master, Lord, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”`,
      `And the Lord said to Jonah, “Are you exceedingly grieved?” Then Jonah went out of the city and seated himself opposite it. There he made for himself a tent and sat under its shade, until he might observe what would happen to the city. And the Lord God commanded a gourd, and it came up over the head of Jonah to be a shade over his head, to shield him from his discomforts. Jonah rejoiced with great joy because of the gourd. But early the next morning, God commanded a worm, and it smote the gourd, and the gourd withered up. And when the sun rose, God commanded a burning east wind; and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah, and he grew faint and despaired of his life. And he said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” Then God said to Jonah, “Are you exceedingly grieved on account of the gourd?” And he said, “I am exceedingly grieved, even unto death.” And the Lord said, “You took pity on the gourd, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came up during the night and perished before the next night. And shall I Myself not take pity upon Nineveh, the great city, in which dwell more than one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know either their right hand or their left—and many livestock?”`,

      `The Journey to Rages`,
      `They went on the journey and came to the Tigris River. So they spent the evening there. The young man went down to wash himself, and a fish jumped up from the river and was determined to swallow the young man. The angel said to him, “Take hold of the fish.” So the young man grabbed the fish and put it on the bank. Then the angel said to him, “Cut open the fish. Take the heart, the liver, and the gall and put them in a safe place.” The young man did as the angel commanded him. Then they cooked the fish and ate it.`,
      `After this, they traveled together until they came near to Ecbatana. Then the young man said to the angel, “Brother Azarias, what is the purpose of the liver, the heart, and the gall of the fish?” He replied, “If a demon or an evil spirit troubles anyone, the heart and the liver must be used to make smoke before the man or woman, and that person will never be troubled again. As for the gall, use it to anoint a man who has white films on his eyes, and he will be healed.”`,
      `As they came near Rages, the angel said to the young man, “Brother, we will spend the night with Raguel. He is your relative and with him is his only child, a daughter named Sarah. I will speak for her that she might be given to you as a wife, because her inheritance belongs to you; for you alone are from her people. The girl is beautiful and she is sensible.`,
      `“So now listen to me, for I will speak to her father. When we return from Rages, we will celebrate the wedding. For I know that Raguel cannot give her to any other man according to the rule of Moses, or he will be subject to death. Thus it is proper that you receive the inheritance rather than another man.”`,
      `Then the young man said to the angel, “Brother Azarias, I have heard the girl was given seven husbands, and they all perished in the bridal chamber. Now I am the only son of my father, and I fear for myself lest, entering the bridal chamber, I may die even as those before me. For a demon loves her, and he does not harm anyone except those who approach her. Now I fear for myself lest I die and bring the life of my father and mother down into their tomb with grief and sorrow upon me. They have no other son who will bury them.”`,
      `But the angel said to him, “Do you not remember the words your father commanded you, to take a wife for yourself from among your people? Now listen to me, brother, for she will be a wife to you. As for the demon, have no concern, for this night she will be given to you as a wife. If you enter the bridal chamber, you will take with you ashes of incense, and lay some of it on the heart and liver of the fish. Then you will make smoke, and the demon will smell it and flee and never return. When you approach her, both of you will rise up and cry out to the merciful God. He will save you and be merciful. Do not fear for yourself, for she has been prepared for you from of old. You will save her and she will go with you. I believe that you will have children by her.”`,
      `As Tobias heard these words, he loved her and his soul was very much united to her.`,
      `At the House of Raguel`,
      `Then they went to Ecbatana and came to the house of Raguel. Sarah went ahead to meet them, and after they greeted one another, she escorted them into the house. Raguel said to Edna his wife, “How the young man resembles my cousin Tobit!” Then Raguel asked them, “Where are you from, brothers?” They answered, “We are from the sons of Naphtali who are captives in Nineveh.” Then he said to them, “Do you know Tobit our brother?” They responded, “We know him.” Then he asked, “Is he in good health?” They answered, “He is alive and in good health.” Tobias then added, “He is my father.”`,
      `Raguel jumped up and kissed him and wept. He blessed him and said to him, “You are the son of a good and noble man!” But when he heard that Tobit had lost his eyesight, he was grieved and wept. Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter also wept, and they received them eagerly. And they killed a ram from the sheep and set many dishes before them.`,
      `Then Tobias said to Raphael, “Brother Azarias, speak about what you said on the way, and let the matter be completed.” So he told Raguel what he said, and Raguel said to Tobias, “Eat, drink, and be glad, for it is fitting for you to marry my child. However, I must tell you the truth. I gave my daughter to seven men, and when they went in to her, they died during the night. But for now, be glad!” But Tobias said, “I will not eat anything until after you establish an agreement with me.” So Raguel said, “Receive her according to the decree, for you are her relative and she is yours. The merciful God will prosper you in what is good.”`,
      `Tobias and Sarah Are Wed`,
      `So he called Sarah his daughter, and taking her by the hand, he gave her to be a wife for Tobias. Then he said, “Behold, receive her according to the decree of Moses, and bring her before your father.” He then blessed them and summoned his wife Edna. She took a scroll and wrote out the agreement. They sealed it, and then they began to eat.`,
      `After this, Raguel called his wife Edna and said to her, “Sister, prepare the other room and lead her into it.” She did as he said and led her there. Then Sarah wept, but Edna understood the tears of her daughter and said to her, 7“Be courageous, my child. May the Lord of heaven and earth give you grace instead of this sorrow of yours. Be courageous, my daughter.”`,
      `When they finished dining, they led Tobias to her. As he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and put the heart and the liver of the fish upon the embers of the incense and made smoke. When the demon smelled the fragrant scent, he fled to the upper parts of Egypt, and there the angel bound him. While both were enclosed in the room, Tobias rose up from the bed and said, “Arise, sister, and let us pray that the Lord will have mercy upon us.” So Tobias began to pray, saying:`,
      `“Blessed are You, O God of our fathers, and blessed is Your holy and glorious name unto the ages. The heavens and all Your creatures bless You. You made Adam and gave him Eve as a helper, his wife as a support. From them the seed of mankind came to be. You said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. Let Us make a helper for him like himself.’ O Lord, I now take this my sister as my wife, not on account of fornication, but in truth. Command that she and I may have mercy, and in this grow old together.”`,
      `And with him she said, “Amen.” Then both fell asleep for the night.`,
      `But Raguel rose up and went outside and dug a grave, saying, “He, too, may have died.” Raguel then went back into his house and said to his wife Edna, “Send one of the maids and let her see if indeed Tobias is alive. If he is not, let us bury him that no one may know.” So the maid went to the door, and when she opened it she found both of them sleeping. She came out and told the two of them that he was alive.`,
      `Then Raguel blessed God, saying:`,
      `“Blessed are You, the God, with every pure and holy blessing. Your holy ones and all Your creatures bless You. All Your angels and Your chosen ones bless You unto all the ages. Blessed are You, for You have made me glad, and it did not turn out for me as I suspected. Rather, You did with us according to Your abundant mercy. Blessed are You, for You had mercy on our two only children. O Lord, show them mercy, and complete their life in health and with gladness and mercy.”`,
      `Then he ordered his household servants to fill in the grave.`,
      `After this he provided a wedding feast for them lasting fourteen days. Before the time of the wedding feast was over, Raguel swore an oath and said to Tobias, “You are not to leave from here unless the two of you stay the fourteen days of the wedding feast. At that time take half of my belongings and go in good health to your father. The remainder will be yours when I and my wife die.”`,
      `Gabael Returns the Silver`,
      `Then Tobias called Raphael and said to him, “Brother Azarias, take a servant and two camels with you and journey to Rages of Media. Find Gabael and bring the silver back to me and bring him to the wedding feast. For Raguel has sworn an oath for me not to go away. But my father is counting the days, and if I delay much longer he will be very distressed.” Then Raphael went and spent the night with Gabael, and gave him the handwritten receipt. So Gabael brought the small sealed bags and gave them to him. They both rose early in the morning and went to the wedding feast. Then Tobias blessed his wife.`,
      `Tobit's Blindness Is Healed`,
      `“My brother, are you not aware of how you left your father? Let us run ahead of your wife and prepare the house. Take the gall of the fish in your hand.” So they proceeded, and the dog followed behind them.`,
      `Meanwhile Anna sat gazing upon the road for her boy. She perceived that he was coming and said to the father, “Behold, your son is coming, and the man traveling with him!”`,
      `Raphael said, “I know that the eyes of your father will open. Rub the gall on his eyes. When the eyes sting, he will rub them and cause the white film to fall away. He will then see you.”`,
      `Then Anna ran up to her son and fell upon his neck and said to him, “I have seen you, my child. From this day, I am now ready to die!” So they both wept. Then Tobit came out of the door. He stumbled, but his son ran up to him. He took hold of his father and dabbed the gall on the eyes of his father, saying, “Father, take courage!” Then as his eyes stung, he rubbed them, and the white films peeled off from the corners of his eyes. When he saw his son, he fell upon his neck, weeping, and said, 4“Blessed are You, O God, and blessed is Your name unto the ages. Blessed are all Your holy angels, for You scourged me but had mercy on me. Behold, I see Tobias my son.” His son went in rejoicing and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.`,
      `Then Tobit rejoiced and blessed God as he went to meet his daughter-in-law at the gate of Nineveh. But those who saw him as he walked along were amazed that he could see. Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. Then as Tobit drew near to meet Sarah, his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, “May you be in good health, my daughter! Blessed is God who brought you to us, and blessed are your father and your mother.”`,
      `So there was rejoicing among all his brethren in Nineveh. Even Ahikar and his nephew Nadab came, for the wedding feast for Tobias was kept with gladness for seven days.`,
      `Raphael Reveals His Identity`,
      `Then Raphael secretly called the two of them, and said to them, “Bless God and give Him thanks. Ascribe greatness to Him and give thanks in the presence of all the living for what He has done for you. It is good to bless God and to exalt His name. Make known the words of God's works honorably and do not delay to give thanks to Him.`,
      `“I will not hide anything from you. Indeed, I did say that it is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Now when you and your daughter-in-law Sarah prayed, I brought the remembrance of your prayer before the Holy One. When you also buried the dead, I was likewise present with you. Then too, when you did not hesitate to stand up and leave your dinner so as to depart and care for the dead, your doing what is good did not escape me; but I was with you. Now God sent me to heal you and Sarah your daughter-in-law. I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who report the prayers of the saints and who enter before the glory of the Holy One.”`,
      `The two of them were troubled and fell upon their faces, for they were afraid. But he said to them, “Do not be afraid, for peace shall be with you. But bless God forever. For I did not come of my own good will, but rather by the will of our God. Therefore bless Him forever. All these days I appeared to you I did not eat or drink; but you were seeing a vision. Now give thanks to God, because I am ascending to Him who sent me. Write in a book everything that was accomplished.”`,
      `Then they stood up, but no longer saw him. They acknowledged the great and wondrous works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.`,

      `Moreover the Lord added this to Ahaz, saying, “Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above.” But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I tempt the Lord.” Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, O house of David, is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary the Lord also? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and you shall call His name Immanuel. Butter and honey He shall eat before He knows to prefer evil or choose the good, for before the Child knows good or evil, He refuses the evil to choose the good; and the land you fear because of the presence of the two kings will be abandoned.`,
      `Moreover the Lord said to me, “Take for yourself a large new book, and write on it with a man's pen concerning making a swift plunder of spoils, for it is near at hand. Then make witnesses for Me of faithful men: Uriah and Zechariah, the son of Berechiah.” Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son, and the Lord said to me, “Call his name Quickly Despoil, Swiftly Plunder; for before the child shall know how to call for his father and mother, one shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria.”`,
      `...and take away from Judah every man able to raise his head or accomplish anything. His encampment will fill the breadth of Your land, O God with us. Know this, O Gentiles, and be defeated. Give ear, all you to the very ends of the earth. Be defeated although you are strong, for even if you should be strong again, you will be defeated again. Then too, whatever counsel you take, the Lord will scatter it abroad; and whatever word you shall speak, it will not continue among you, for the Lord God is with us.” `,

The Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and godliness. The Spirit of the fear of God shall fill Him. He shall not judge by reputation nor convict by common talk. But He will judge the cause of the humble, and reprove the humble of the earth. He shall strike the earth with the word of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the ungodly. He shall gird His loins with righteousness and cover his sides with truth.`,

The cow and the bear shall graze together, and their young ones shall lie down together. The lion and the ox shall eat straw together. The nursing child shall play by the hole of asps, and the weaned child shall put his hand in the den of asps. They shall not hurt nor be able to destroy anyone on My holy mountain, for the whole world shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as much water covers the seas.`,
